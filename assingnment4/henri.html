        <p>
          French painter and artist Henri Matisse wrote these lines in his 1947 book <em>Jazz</em>, which feature a collection  of his recent work and thoughts. After a surgery left him bed bound and unable to paint and sculpt, he looked for new ways to create art. Not being discouraged, he used coloured paper to create large collages that are know as cut-outs.
        </p>
        <p>We imagine his encouraging words reflect this process of not giving up and instead pursuing new paths. In full, the quote says: “Happy are those who sing with all their heart, from the bottoms of their hearts. To find joy in the sky, the trees, the flowers. There are always flowers for those who want to see them.”</p>
        <p>A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division Angiospermae). Flowers produce gametophytes, which in flowering plants consist of a few haploid cells which produce gametes. The "male" gametophyte, which produces non-motile sperm, is enclosed within pollen grains; the "female" gametophyte is contained within the ovule. When pollen from the anther of a flower is deposited on the stigma, this is called pollination. Some flowers may self-pollinate, producing seed using pollen from the same flower or a different flower of the same plant, but others have mechanisms to prevent self-pollination and rely on cross-pollination, when pollen is transferred from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower on a different individual of the same species.</p>
        <p>Self-pollination happens in flowers where the stamen and carpel mature at the same time, and are positioned so that the pollen can land on the flower's stigma. This pollination does not require an investment from the plant to provide nectar and pollen as food for pollinators.</p>
